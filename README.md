# Weather-Forecasting-using-ML

## Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using machine learning algorithms. It employs historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., to forecast future weather conditions. The model is trained on a dataset containing past weather records and can predict weather patterns for a specific location.
